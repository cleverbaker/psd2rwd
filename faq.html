<h5>FAQ</h5>
<p><span class="italic">What happens, if for whatever reason, the project is not complete Tuesday morning at 9am?
</span><br>
A stable version of the most complete version of the code will be delivered Tuesday morning. We will continue to make updates throughout the day (and the following day if necessary). Because the delivered version is stable, it can be launched immediately in case of an urgent hard deadline.
<br><br>


<p><span class="italic">What happens if I discover bugs after the QA Review on the Demo Call?
</span><br>
If you discover bugs let us know right away. Fixing any bugs for you is our top priority for the rest of the day and the next day following the Demo Call. After that we assume code implementation went smoothly. If anything comes up, let us know and we will help make it right.
<br><br>

<p><span class="italic">What happens if only one person from your team is available for the Kickoff Call of the Demo Call?</span><br>
Two people are required to be on the call. These two people are important points of contact for the PSD 2 RWD team during our one-week sprint. We at PSD 2 RWD are looking to do business with agencies who have the resources to have two contacts available for the duration of each project.
<br><br>

<p><span class="italic">Do you use any frameworks or code libraries with the PSD conversion codebase?
</span><br>
Yes. We use Zurb Foundation for responsive layout and device compatibility

<p><span class="italic">Is a PSD to RWD web page conversion really worth that much?
</span><br>
The PSD to RWD web page conversions are priced at Small-$695, Medium-$925, and Large-$1195. Let’s assume that a Jr Developer paid $34.75/hr can have a Small project complete in 20 hours, done deal; a Mid-Level Developer paid $46.25/hr can have a Medium project wrapped up in 20 hours; a Sr. Developer paid $59.75/hr do a Large solid, ready to launch, including debugging in 20 hours. Now what is the likelihood that your project will take more than 20 hours?
<br><br>

<p><span class="italic">How do you process payments?
</span><br>
We send you an online invoice. Payments are made by credit/debit card only and are processed by Stripe. The invoice is sent early in the morning with the code, for review. For a PSD conversion, ayment is made during the Demo Call. For monthly memberships with up to three PSD conversions per month, payment is made on the first of the month.
