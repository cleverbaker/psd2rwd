<h5>FAQ</h5>
<ul style='list-style-type:none'>
  <li>
    <p><span class="italic">What happens, if for whatever reason, the project is not complete by the scheduled Tuesday morning at 9am?
    </span><br>
    A stable version of the most complete version of the code will be delivered Tuesday morning. We will continue to make updates throughout the day (and the following day if necessary). Because the delivered version is stable, it can be launched immediately in case of an urgent hard deadline.
    <br><br>
  </li>



  <li>
    <p><span class="italic">What happens if I discover bugs after the QA Review on the Demo Call?
</span><br>
If you discover bugs let us know right away. Fixing any bugs for you is our top priority for the rest of the day and the next day following the Demo Call. After that we assume code implementation went smoothly. If anything comes up, let us know and we will help make it right.
<br><br>

  <li>
    <p><span class="italic">What happens if I only have one person available for the Kickoff Call or the Demo Call?</span><br>
Two people are required to be on the call from the customer's team for the Kickoff Call and the Demo Call. These two people are important points of contact for the PSD 2 RWD team during our one-week sprint. (Two people from the PSD 2 RWD team are required to be on each call too).
<br><br>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p><span class="italic">Do you use any frameworks or code libraries with the PSD conversion codebase?
</span><br>
Yes. We use Zurb Foundation in most projects for responsive layout and device compatibility.
<br><br>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p><span class="italic">Is a PSD 2 RWD web page conversion really worth that much?
</span><br>
The PSD to RWD web page conversions are priced at Small-$695, Medium-$925, and Large-$1195. Let’s assume that a Jr Developer paid $34.75/hr can have a Small project complete in 20 hours, done deal; a Mid-Level Developer paid $46.25/hr can have a Medium project wrapped up in 20 hours; a Sr. Developer paid $59.75/hr can do a Large solid landing page, ready to launch, including debugging, in 20 hours. Now what is the likelihood that your project will take more than 20 hours?
<br><br>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p><span class="italic">How does PSD 2 RWD process payments?
</span><br>
We send you an online invoice via Harvest. Payments are made by credit/debit card or by ACH transfer. We use Striipe for our payment processing service, so we never see your card number or bank info.
For a single PSD conversion, the invoice is sent early in the morning along with the code, payment is to be made that same day during the Demo Call.<br>
For monthly memberships with up to three PSD conversions per month, payments are made at the start of the membership and on every 1st of the month. You can cancel when you don't need it, and rejoin when you need bunches of responsive landing pages again. 
<br><br>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p><span class="italic">Can I do more than one PSD conversion at a time?
</span><br>
Yes.
<br><br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><span class="italic">Can I join the Premium Membership during the last week of a calendar month?
</span><br>
No. Premium Memberships, for up to three PSD conversions per month, can only be ordered during the first three weeks of each calendar month.
<br><br>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p><span class="italic">How do you test for different browsers on different devices?
</span><br>
Firstly, we test the validity of the code through peer review and compiler review. Secondly, we test the responsive webpage on all the devices and browsers available on hand. We also subscribe to mass browser/device testing services and have access to local device testing labs via <a href="https://opendevicelab.com/">OpenDeviceLab.com</a>.
