          <h4>Optimized image and video sizes</h4>
          <p>One of the biggest problems with bloated web pages and slow page loading on responsive websites are images. Especially with the growing number of “Retina Devices,” people want higher resolution images for their sites and it’s important that pages don’t become cluttered with 1mb image files.

          <h4>Responsive text sizes and font margins</h4>
          <p>Typography is one of the most important aspects of responsive web design, and optimizing your fonts for mobile devices is an absolute necessity if you want your content to be palatable across all screen sizes. We optimize your typography for every viewport.

          <p>Navigation patterns in responsive web design can be tricky to tackle. Central to a solid user experience is a well-structured, simple navigation system. It doesn’t matter how good your website is if users can’t find their way around it.

    <p>
    At PSD 2 RWD, we do 7-day sprints (including the weekend) for each Photoshop to responsive web page conversion.<br>These 7-day sprints are book-ended by the Kickoff Call and the Demo Call.<br>
    The Kickoff Call and the Demo Call are very important, as discussed below.<br>
    Code is delivered first, and then payment is made on the last day of the sprint.<br>
    Code is delivered with all the image assets and code dependencies with a brief write-up with instructions and comments.<br>
    <br>Payment is due in full at the end of the sprint.
    <br>If any bugs come up down the road, we'll take care of them.
    <br>
    <p>1.  Before the Sprint
    <br>2.  The Sprint
    <br>3.  After the Sprint
    <h5 class="stage-title">Before the Sprint</h5>
    <p>Signed NDA
    <br>Schedule a Kickoff Call
    <br>Your layered PSD mockup emailed/uploaded
    <br>Menus instructions (wireframe or specs) included
    <br>Layouts (wireframes or mockups) included

<p>What are the next steps you are going to take after your beautiful design is now a slick responsive site? You'll probably use it as a landing page or implement it as a theme in your content management system.
<p>But first, you'll probably try it out yourself, play with it by resizing the browser window, testing it on your phone.. then you'll show it off to your boss or client, and celebrate the milestone victory.
<p>We assume you have a technical person on your team that we're handing the code off to and that's who's going to launch the landing page or implementing the code into your CMS.
