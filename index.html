          <h4>Optimized image and video sizes</h4>
          <p>One of the biggest problems with bloated web pages and slow page loading on responsive websites are images. Especially with the growing number of “Retina Devices,” people want higher resolution images for their sites and it’s important that pages don’t become cluttered with 1mb image files.

          <p>Fluid grids flow naturally within the dimensions of its parent container, limited adjustments will be needed for various screen sizes and devices. Because it uses percentages, your fluid columns will fit into any width.

          <h4>Responsive text sizes and font margins</h4>
          <p>Typography is one of the most important aspects of responsive web design, and optimizing your fonts for mobile devices is an absolute necessity if you want your content to be palatable across all screen sizes. We optimize your typography for every viewport.

          <h4>Responsive navigation menus</h4>
          <p>Navigation patterns in responsive web design can be tricky to tackle. Central to a solid user experience is a well-structured, simple navigation system. It doesn’t matter how good your website is if users can’t find their way around it.

    <p class="quote">In product development, a sprint is a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review.<a href="http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Scrum-sprint" class="reference-link">*</a><br>
    <p>
    At PSD 2 RWD, we do 7-day sprints (including the weekend) for each Photoshop to responsive web page conversion.<br>These 7-day sprints are book-ended by the Kickoff Call and the Demo Call.<br>
    The Kickoff Call and the Demo Call are very important, as discussed below.<br>
    Code is delivered first, and then payment is made on the last day of the sprint.<br>
    Code is delivered with all the image assets and code dependencies with a brief write-up with instructions and comments.<br>
    <br>Payment is due in full at the end of the sprint.
    <br>If any bugs come up down the road, we'll take care of them.
    <br>
    <p>1.  Before the Sprint
    <br>2.  The Sprint
    <br>3.  After the Sprint

<p>What are the next steps you are going to take after your beautiful design is now a slick responsive site? You'll probably use it as a landing page or implement it as a theme in your content management system.
<p>But first, you'll probably try it out yourself, play with it by resizing the browser window, testing it on your phone.. then you'll show it off to your boss or client, and celebrate the milestone victory.
<p>We assume you have a technical person on your team that we're handing the code off to and that's who's going to launch the landing page or implementing the code into your CMS.
